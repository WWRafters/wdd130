    <h2>Hi My Name is Tyson</h2>
    <p>I live in Saratoga, Utah.</p>
    <p>I'm super excited to be apart of this class and having the ability to further my skills</p>
    <p>in a field that has always peaked my interest computer science. The end goal is to obtain a Cyber Security Degree.</p>
    <p>I love spending time with family watching movies, cooking, and playing video games.</p>
    <p>My favorite movie right now is Spiderman: Across the Spider-verse. Great Movie!</p>
    <p>I love cooking Smoked Baby-back Ribs, and I've been stuck on Mario-cart lately.</p>
